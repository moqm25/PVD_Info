<p>Being a PVD means you’ll use <strong>your personal vehicle</strong> as a delivery van, so it’s crucial that your car meets UPS’s requirements and that you have the proper equipment for the job. Below is what UPS expects:</p>
<h2>Personal Vehicle Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliable, Registered &amp; Insured:</strong> Your vehicle must be <strong>registered in your name (or authorized for your use)</strong> and properly insured with at least the <strong>state-required auto insurance coverage</strong>. UPS will ask for proof of registration and insurance during onboarding. <em>Importantly, check with your auto insurance provider</em> that using your car for deliveries is allowed under your policy. (UPS provides supplemental insurance while you’re on the job, but your personal policy must permit commercial/delivery use for that coverage to apply.)</li>
<li><strong>Vehicle Type:</strong> Almost any <strong>reliable passenger vehicle</strong> can qualify – common choices are sedans, SUVs, wagons, or minivans – as long as it meets UPS standards. The vehicle <strong>must have a closed top or covered cargo area</strong>. If you drive a pickup truck, it needs a secure cover on the bed (open convertibles or motorcycles are not permitted). Your car should be in <strong>good working condition</strong> (no significant mechanical issues) and <strong>free of major visible damage</strong> that would make UPS look bad or hinder safe driving. UPS also specifies the vehicle should weigh under 10,000 lbs and <strong>not have extreme modifications</strong> (for example, no oversized lift kits or racing-style low suspension) – essentially, a standard, safe vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>No External Advertising:</strong> UPS <strong>prohibits any other company logos, markings, or bumper stickers</strong> on your car while you’re working. Your vehicle should be unbranded (aside from normal manufacturer logos) to avoid confusion. UPS does <em>not</em> typically provide magnetic signs or decals for PVDs, so your car will remain unmarked as a UPS vehicle – your <strong>uniform/vest will identify you</strong> instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Required Equipment and Gear</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smartphone &amp; Apps:</strong> In many locations, PVDs are expected to use a <strong>smartphone</strong> with the UPS delivery app for scanning packages and navigating routes. UPS will provide the app login and training on how to use it. Ensure you have a <strong>reliable phone with a data plan</strong> – it’s a crucial tool for this job. <em>(Note: In some areas, UPS may issue a handheld device or even a phone to you. Other times, you’ll use your own phone and UPS will pay a <strong>phone stipend</strong> on your paycheck to offset data usage.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Uniform &amp; Appearance:</strong> UPS will supply you with a <strong>uniform</strong> – typically this might be the iconic brown UPS shirt and pants, or at minimum a <strong>UPS-branded reflective vest</strong> to wear over your own clothes. <strong>You are required to wear the UPS uniform/vest</strong> whenever on duty, along with any required ID badge. Adhere to UPS appearance guidelines: keep a neat, professional appearance (UPS has relaxed some old rules on hair and tattoos, but you should still look well-groomed and approachable). The provided vest or uniform makes you easily identifiable to customers.</li>
<li><strong>Footwear:</strong> You must provide your own <strong>work shoes or boots</strong>. UPS policy requires <strong>comfortable, closed-toe shoes</strong> with a <strong>sturdy upper</strong> (for support) and <strong>non-slip soles</strong>. You’ll be doing a lot of walking and stepping in and out of your vehicle, possibly on wet or icy surfaces, so invest in quality slip-resistant footwear. Breaking in your shoes before peak season is a good idea to avoid blisters.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Gear:</strong> UPS will include any necessary safety gear in your uniform kit (the reflective vest is standard). It’s wise to also keep a <strong>flashlight</strong> (for after-dark deliveries), a pair of <strong>work gloves</strong> (for handling dozens of packages, especially in cold weather), and perhaps a <strong>rain jacket</strong> or umbrella handy. These aren’t official requirements, but they’ll help you do the job comfortably and safely in all conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicle Prep:</strong> Before peak season starts, prepare your car for the job. Remove clutter from your trunk and back seat so you have maximum cargo space. It’s often helpful to lay down a blanket or tarp in the cargo area to protect your car’s interior from dirt or to slide heavy boxes. You might also consider investing in <strong>cargo bins or boxes</strong> to help organize packages in your vehicle (organization tips are covered in the next section). Ensure your car’s maintenance is up-to-date (oil change, tire check, etc.) because you’ll be putting extra miles on it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maintenance &amp; Fuel:</strong> UPS covers the cost of fuel for your deliveries (more on fuel reimbursement in the Pay section), but <strong>you are responsible for your vehicle’s maintenance and general wear-and-tear</strong>. Keep an eye on your gas tank (start each day with a full tank if possible), and maintain your car (fluids, brakes, tires) so you don’t risk a breakdown mid-route. Remember, if your personal car breaks down, there is no UPS spare vehicle for you – it’s on you to have reliable transportation throughout the season.</p>
