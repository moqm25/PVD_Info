<p>This section walks you through a typical day and the standard procedures for PVDs – from picking up packages to delivering them safely and efficiently. As a PVD, you will be trained on UPS’s methods, but here’s an overview of <strong>step-by-step operations</strong> and best practices:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start of Day – Check-In and Package Pickup:</strong> Arrive at the designated UPS facility <strong>on time (or a few minutes early)</strong> for your scheduled shift. You’ll typically start your day at a dispatch area where you’ll verify your packages and load them into your vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Navigating Your Delivery Route:</strong> UPS will provide you with a list of delivery addresses – often through the mobile app or a printed manifest. In some cases, PVDs can have input on their route, especially if you know the area well. Use the app for efficient navigation and scanning.</li>
<li><strong>Parking & Approaching the Delivery Location:</strong> For each stop, find a <strong>safe place to park</strong> your vehicle. If you’re in a residential area, you can usually pull into the customer’s driveway. Use hazard lights if you’re stopping on the street.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery to the Customer:</strong> Whenever possible, <strong>deliver packages directly to the recipient’s door</strong> or a secure location near it. UPS’s service is typically <strong>doorstep delivery</strong>, not mailbox delivery. Handle packages with care and place them neatly.</li>
<li><strong>During Your Route – Scanning and Issues:</strong> Throughout your route, you’ll use the UPS app or device to <strong>manage stops and scanning</strong>. Typically, you’ll scan each package <strong>twice</strong>: first at pickup and again at delivery. Report any issues (like damaged packages) through the app.</li>
<li><strong>End of Day – Return and Check-Out:</strong> Your day isn’t done until all your packages are accounted for. After you have finished all deliveries (or if your shift time is ending), <strong>head back to the UPS facility</strong>, return any undelivered packages, and check out with your supervisor.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Additional Operational Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Seasoned drivers recommend methods like carrying a <strong>package tote or large bag</strong> to consolidate multiple small packages on a single trip to a house (especially useful in apartment complexes).</li>
<li><strong>Housekeeping:</strong> Bring a <strong>trash bag</strong> in your car for things like shrink wrap or tape peels from packages, empty water bottles, etc. Keeping your car tidy prevents confusion (you don’t want trash mixed with packages).</li>
<li><strong>Customer Preferences:</strong> Occasionally customers leave notes (e.g., “UPS: please leave packages at side door” or “don’t ring bell, baby sleeping”). Be observant for any such instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Speed vs. Safety:</strong> During peak season, you might feel pressure to go faster. Remember, <strong>safety is the top priority at UPS</strong>. It’s better to complete your route a bit late but safely and accurately.</li>
