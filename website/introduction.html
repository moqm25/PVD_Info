<h2>Overview of the PVD Role</h2>
<p>A Personal Vehicle Driver (PVD) is a seasonal UPS employee who uses their own vehicle to deliver packages during peak periods (typically the holiday season). In this fast-paced, physical job, you perform the same duties as a UPS package delivery driver – picking up packages from a UPS location, driving a set route, and delivering to customers – but you do it in your personal car. PVDs help UPS handle the surge in deliveries between roughly October and December, and the role ends after the seasonal rush (though high-performing PVDs may be invited back or even transition into permanent roles).</p>

<h2>Basic Eligibility Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age &amp; Licensing:</strong> You must be at least <strong>21 years old</strong> and hold a <strong>valid driver’s license</strong> in the state where you will work. A clean driving record is essential (generally <strong>no moving violations in the past 12 months</strong> and <strong>no at-fault accidents in the last 3 years</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Background &amp; Screening:</strong> All applicants undergo a background check. You should have no serious criminal convictions or felonies on record. UPS may also require a drug screening during the hiring process (this can vary by location).</li>
<li><strong>Physical Ability:</strong> The job is <strong>physically demanding</strong>. You must be able to lift, lower, and carry packages up to <strong>70 pounds</strong> safely on a regular basis. This means you should be in good physical condition and prepared for long periods of walking, carrying, and climbing stairs with packages.</li>
<li><strong>Employment Status:</strong> As a PVD, you are <strong>hired as a UPS employee (seasonal)</strong>, not an independent contractor. You will be on UPS’s payroll, follow UPS policies, and be part of the UPS team during your tenure. (Many PVDs are <strong>re-hired annually</strong> for the holiday season, and UPS notes that about <strong>35% of seasonal hires</strong> eventually earn permanent positions.)</li>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Because this role exists to meet <strong>peak-season demand</strong>, you need a flexible schedule during the holidays. PVDs typically work <strong>full-time hours during November-December</strong>, and UPS expects you to commit through the end of the peak period. Being available on <strong>short notice</strong> and willing to work long days or six-day weeks in December is often necessary as package volume climbs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you meet these requirements and are interested, the application process is straightforward. You can apply online via the UPS jobs portal by searching for “Seasonal Personal Vehicle Driver” in your area. UPS will have you complete an online application, watch a few orientation videos, and submit required paperwork (like your driver’s license, proof of insurance, and vehicle info). If hired, you’ll receive training before hitting the road.</p>
