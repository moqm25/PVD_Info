<p>UPS has a saying: <em>“Safety is our highest priority.”</em> The company invests heavily in training its drivers to operate safely and interact professionally with customers. As a PVD, you are expected to uphold UPS’s safety standards and provide excellent service.</p>
<h2>Driving Safety Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay Alert &amp; Avoid Distractions:</strong> Keep your eyes moving, constantly scanning for potential hazards. Absolutely no texting or app fiddling while driving – pull over safely if you need to use the app.</li>
<li><strong>Obey All Traffic Laws:</strong> Observe speed limits and come to complete stops at stop signs. Always wear your seat belt.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Following Distance:</strong> Maintain a cushion of space between you and the vehicle ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize Backing Up:</strong> If possible, plan your stops so you can avoid backing your car.</li>
<li><strong>Use Your Lights:</strong> Since you might deliver into the evening hours, ensure your headlights are on as dusk approaches and use hazard flashers when stopped roadside.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicle Condition:</strong> Do a quick <strong>pre-trip check</strong> each day. If something critical fails, stop operations and inform your supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Package Handling & Personal Safety</h2>
<p>Practice <strong>proper lifting techniques</strong> to protect your back. Be mindful of <strong>weather conditions</strong> and wear appropriate footwear and gear.</p>
<h2>Customer Interaction & Service</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professional Appearance &amp; Demeanor:</strong> Always wear your UPS uniform or vest during deliveries and keep it visible.</li>
<li><strong>Respect Customer Property:</strong> Stick to driveways or walkways and close any gates behind you.</li>
<li><strong>Handling Signatures and IDs:</strong> Follow UPS protocol exactly when a delivery requires a signature or ID check.</li>
<li><strong>Difficult Situations:</strong> Stay calm if a customer is upset and advise them to contact UPS customer service for further help.</li>
<li><strong>Animals and Pets:</strong> Treat all unknown dogs as potentially unfriendly and avoid approaching if a dog is aggressive.</li>
<li><strong>COVID-19 and Hygiene Protocols:</strong> Adhere to any current guidelines regarding masks or contact-free delivery.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Emergencies and Accidents</h2>
<p>If you are involved in a vehicle accident or have an injury while on the job, follow UPS emergency protocols and contact your supervisor immediately.</p>
<h2>Protecting Packages and Vehicle</h2>
<p>While rare, package theft or vehicle break-ins can happen. Keep your vehicle locked whenever possible and park in well-lit areas.</p>
<h2>UPS Safety Culture</h2>
<p>UPS has a robust safety culture – embrace it. Attend any safety meetings or briefings offered to seasonal drivers.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Prioritize safety every moment – from how you lift packages to how you drive and how you interact with customers.</p>
