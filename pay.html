<p>Understanding how you’ll be scheduled and compensated as a PVD is important for managing your expectations (and your wallet!). This section covers your hourly pay, how scheduling works, work hours, and other important considerations.</p>
<h2>Hourly Pay Rate</h2>
<p>UPS PVDs earn a competitive hourly wage. The exact pay rate can vary by region and year, but as of recent seasons UPS has advertised a starting pay of around <strong>$21 per hour</strong>.</p>
<h2>Paycheck & Taxes</h2>
<p>UPS pays weekly during the peak season. You will receive a paycheck (or direct deposit) <strong>each week</strong>, usually with a one-week delay. For example, your hours worked in Week 1 will be paid out on the paycheck you receive during Week 2.</p>
<h2>Mileage & Expense Reimbursement</h2>
<p>One major perk of the PVD program is that UPS will compensate you for the use of your personal vehicle through <strong>mileage reimbursement</strong>. This is meant to cover gas and wear-and-tear on your car.</p>
<h2>Scheduling & Hours</h2>
<p>Scheduling for PVDs can be somewhat flexible but is driven by package volume. Generally, when you’re hired, UPS will ask for your availability (which days of the week you can work) and then build schedules around that.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility and Notification:</strong> Depending on your UPS location, scheduling might be done weekly or even day-to-day. You may have a set schedule (e.g., “plan to work Monday–Friday starting at noon each day”) or you might be on a call-in basis where they’ll confirm your shift the day before.</p>
<p><strong>Peak Season Expectations:</strong> Peak season at UPS is intense. The volume of packages can be double or triple the rest of the year. As a PVD, you are brought on specifically to handle this spike.</p>
<p><strong>Time Tracking:</strong> In most cases, your <strong>time is tracked via the DIAD app or by supervisors</strong>. You may not physically punch a clock; instead, your shift start/end might be recorded when you log into the delivery app or when you radio in “all clear.”</p>
<p><strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> During these weeks, plan for limited free time, especially if you’re working full-time elsewhere or taking classes. PVD work can be tiring, and you’ll likely want to rest on days off.</p>
<h2>Summary of Compensation</h2>
<p>To recap, as a UPS PVD you earn an hourly wage (paid weekly), <strong>plus</strong> additional pay for mileage (and possibly phone use). You won’t have long-term benefits since it’s seasonal, but the hourly pay is significant and the money can be great for a short-term gig.</p>
