<h2>Q: What kind of schedule can I expect as a PVD? Will I be working every day or just when needed?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> PVD schedules are driven by holiday package volume. In general, you should be prepared to work <strong>5 days a week, potentially 6 days during the busiest weeks of December</strong>. Many PVDs work full-time hours during November and December.</p>
<h2>Q: Do I have to use my own car, or will UPS ever provide a vehicle?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The <strong>“Personal Vehicle”</strong> in PVD means yes, you will be using your own car 100% of the time for this role. UPS will not provide a UPS truck or van to PVDs.</p>
<h2>Q: How does UPS pay for my gas and vehicle use? Is there a separate gas allowance?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> UPS will compensate you through <strong>mileage reimbursement</strong> for each mile you drive on the job. This is calculated at a cents-per-mile rate (often the IRS standard mileage rate).</p>
<h2>Q: What should I wear while working? Do I get a UPS uniform?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> UPS will provide you with the necessary uniform items. Seasonal PVDs typically receive either a <strong>brown UPS driver shirt</strong> or <strong>jacket</strong>, or a <strong>high-visibility UPS vest</strong> (or both).</p>
<h2>Q: How many packages will I have to deliver in a day? Is it as heavy a workload as regular UPS drivers?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The number of packages can vary quite a bit by location and day. Generally, PVDs handle fewer packages than a full-time UPS driver. As a PVD you might deliver 100 or more packages per day in mid-December.</p>
<h2>Q: What kind of training will I get? I’ve never done this before – how will I learn the systems and scanner?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> UPS provides <strong>paid training</strong> before you start delivering on your own. The training for PVDs is condensed but covers the essentials.</p>
<h2>Q: Are there opportunities to stay on with UPS after the seasonal job?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Possibly, yes. While the PVD role is designed as a <strong>seasonal position</strong>, UPS frequently needs new permanent employees, and they often look at their pool of seasonal workers to fill those roles.</p>
<h2>Q: What if I can’t deliver a package (can’t find address, customer not home for signature, etc.)?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> UPS has clear methods for these scenarios. If you <strong>cannot find an address</strong>, first double-check GPS and address label details. Leave a note or mark for reattempt if necessary.</p>
<h2>Q: Is the job dangerous or what are the biggest challenges I should be aware of?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> “Dangerous” is a strong word – UPS has many thousands of drivers on the road every day who come home safe. By following the safety training and using common sense, you greatly mitigate risks.</p>
<p>Good luck and welcome to UPS’s peak season team! Being a Personal Vehicle Driver is hard work, but it can also be rewarding. You’ll be a critical part of making the holidays happen for countless people.</p>
